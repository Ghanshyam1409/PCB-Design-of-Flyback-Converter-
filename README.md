# PCB-Design-of-Flyback-Converter-
 PCB Design  of closed loop operation  Flyback Converter 
Flyback converter is DC-DC converter it is isolated converter we use transformer to boost the output voltage as compare to conventional DC-DC converter, Here we design the PCB for closed Loop opreation of Flyback Converter for controlling the output voltage of flyback converter we use type -II Compenstor topology
